title: Caring for Your Body While Programming
---

Let's face it, locking into the coding "flow" state, as desirable as it is for productivity, can cause us to completely disregard all else - including the needs of our own body.  As a new programmer, I learned this lesson the hard way.  On the bright side, I never imagined coding could be so engaging; how the heck did five hours fly by already?  I should probably eat something, but I'm so close to solving this!! 

That's where the danger begins.
