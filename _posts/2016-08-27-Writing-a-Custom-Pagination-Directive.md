title: Writing a Custom Pagination Directive in Angular
---

There are many resources out there to assist with pagination of an Angular app, one example being [Michael Bromley's pagination directive](https://github.com/michaelbromley/angularUtils/tree/master/src/directives/pagination#working-with-asynchronous-data), a nice "plug-n-play" solution for divvying up your index items. While normally one would not re-invent the wheel unnecessarily, I decided to implement my own pagination in my latest project for the sake of the learning experience.  And it ended up being quite the learning experience.
