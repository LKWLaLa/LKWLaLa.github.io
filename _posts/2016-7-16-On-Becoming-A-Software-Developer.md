title: On Becoming a Software Developer

(Or spending the greater part of a year as a hermit, in hopes of promoting human connection.)


##I did not grow up tinkering with the command line, or with a passion for video games.  

##However - I do love to create, invent, and explore.

##I love learning, and want to understand our world.

##And find a way to bring people together.
