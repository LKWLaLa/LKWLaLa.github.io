“It is not enough to be industrious; so are the ants. What are you industrious about?” 
― Henry David Thoreau


###1. I did not grow up tinkering with the command line, or with a passion for video games.  

###2. However - I do love to create, invent, and explore.

###3. I love learning, and want to understand our world.

###4. And find a way to bring people together.
