title: On Becoming a Software Developer
---


The other day I was introduced to a woman who, in a polite exchange of pleasantries insisted, "So, tell me about your career!"  After listing off some of my history (music, dance, arts/business administration, sign language interpreting) I explained my current path to becoming a developer, as well as my excitement at having completed a major project in the past week.  With delight and amusement she declared, "Well, isn't that just the antithesis of creativity!"  Taking another sip of her drink, she shared anecdotes of friends who had made grand exits from the arts world, escaping to accounting or otherwise.  "So interesting!"

Discussion of the value of the arts aside, I am pursuing development not in spite of, but *because* of my attraction to creative work.  I see it as a logical culmination of my experiences so far - bringing ideas to life, problem solving, choreographing the necessary steps toward creation of a product that could improve someone's experience of the world.  






â€œThe developer stands before her source code editor in the same way the author confronts the blank page...When the module is finished or the pages complete, their quality is judged against many of the same standards: elegance, concision, cohesion; the discovery of symmetries where none were seen to exist. Yes, even beauty."
