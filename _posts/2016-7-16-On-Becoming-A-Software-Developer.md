title: On Becoming a Software Developer
---

â€œThe developer stands before her source code editor in the same way the author confronts the blank page...When the module is finished or the pages complete, their quality is judged against many of the same standards: elegance, concision, cohesion; the discovery of symmetries where none were seen to exist. Yes, even beauty."

- J. Bradford Hipps 
(New York Times, "To Write Better Code, Read Virginia Woolf" - May 2016)
