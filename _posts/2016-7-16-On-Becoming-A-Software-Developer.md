title: On Becoming a Software Developer
---


The other day I was introduced to a woman who, in a polite exchange of pleasantries insisted, "So, tell me about your career!"  After listing off a short history of my past endeavors - music, dance, arts/business administration, sign language interpreting - I explained my current path to becoming a developer, as well as my excitement at having completed a major project in the past week.  With delight and amusement in her eyes, she declared, "Well, isn't that just the antithesis of creativity!"






â€œThe developer stands before her source code editor in the same way the author confronts the blank page...When the module is finished or the pages complete, their quality is judged against many of the same standards: elegance, concision, cohesion; the discovery of symmetries where none were seen to exist. Yes, even beauty."
