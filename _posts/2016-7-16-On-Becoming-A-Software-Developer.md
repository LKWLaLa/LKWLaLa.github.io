title: On Becoming a Software Developer
---


The other day I was introduced to a woman who, in a polite exchange of pleasantries insisted, "So, tell me about your career!"  After listing off some of my history (music, dance, arts/business administration, sign language interpreting) I explained my current path to becoming a developer, as well as my excitement at having completed a major project in the past week.  With delight and amusement she declared, "Well, isn't that just the antithesis of creativity!"  Taking another sip of her drink, she shared anecdotes of friends who had made grand exits from the arts world, escaping to accounting or otherwise.  "So interesting!"

Discussion of what is or is not artistic aside, I am pursuing development not in spite of, but *because* of my attraction to creative work.  I see it as a logical culmination of my experiences so far - bringing ideas to life, problem solving, choreographing the necessary steps toward creation of something tangible that could improve someone's experience of the world.  

I am a proponent of accessible technology, growing up with autism in my family, as well as spending a significant amount of time with friends and mentors in the Deaf community.  I feel hope and excitement at the possibility of work that could break down barriers and bring people together.  

Not to mention, coding itself - beginning with a blank slate and creating something useful out of nothing - is a process that requires curiousity, open-mindedness, logic, empathy, and dare I say even - artfulness.  Recently, I read a New York Times piece by softward developer J. Bradford Hipps, [*To Write Better Code, Read Virginia Woolf*](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/opinion/sunday/to-write-software-read-novels.html?_r=0), in which he writes:


â€œThe developer stands before her source code editor in the same way the author confronts the blank page...When the module is finished or the pages complete, their quality is judged against many of the same standards: elegance, concision, cohesion; the discovery of symmetries where none were seen to exist. Yes, even beauty."
