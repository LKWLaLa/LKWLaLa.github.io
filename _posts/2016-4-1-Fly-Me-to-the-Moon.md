In other words... getting a Sinatra based framework up and running:

After a few months of working only in the command line, creating an MVC patterned web app has been really exciting!  As the case with the majority of the population, I've grown accustomed to interacting with a user interface of sorts.  So creating an application that actually renders in the browser is satisfying in a familiar sort of way.  While I have an enormous amount left to learn simply to cover the basics of web development, I have a new burst of energy feeling that I am finally moving into the "meat and potatoes" of the curriculum.  

That said, building in Sinatra for the first time was quite the challenge for me.  (Which is fun, because I love a good challenge!)  Ironically, in planning out my code, scratch paper and a pencil has become my best friend.  One of the most mind bending aspects of the process actually occurred before typing a single line - figuring out the relationships between my models.  Sometimes it is not so obvious whether to use a has_many, a has_many through, or a many to many relationship until drawing it out on paper.   In figuring this out, there is certainly an element of deciding what feels most intuitive and representative of the real world objects you are mimicking/organizing, but visualization is helpful too!

Over the past decade, swing dancing has been a large part of my life, so (perhaps I was feeling inspired by Frank Sinatra), I decided to create an application that can help with organization of dance steps to practice and the video clips they may be found in.  I established a many-to-many join table "video_step," and rendered check boxes for users to associate multiple videos with the dance step they are working on, as well as multiple steps that may be found in one video.  I also played around with styling my app using Bootstrap and a few CSS tweaks, as we didn't have a project at the end of the CSS section of the curriculum and I wanted to feel more comfortable using it.  It was a bit tedious (oh, please gray box, just move a little to the left - ack!), but also super rewarding when all of the components came together.

I also purposefully included the use of checkboxes in my code, as working with nested hashes and complex forms was a portion of the curriculum I needed more practice with. Implementing the feature in my own project, as opposed to within the structure of a Learn lab forced my brain to solidify its own understanding, and was super helpful. 

At the completion of this project, I am feeling much more comfortable with the nuts and bolts of a basic web application, not to mention, I now have a fun application to help me organize my dance steps!  Rewarding on all accounts.

I can't help but to continue thinking of other handy features I would like to build into my app, but for now, they will have to wait for another day. I'll be itching to continue building out my projects when I complete this program (if I don't decide to rewrite them entirely when I have a larger knowledge base.)

Next up, Rails..!
