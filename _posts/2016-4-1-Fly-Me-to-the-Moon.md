In other words... getting a Sinatra based framework up and running:

After a few months of working only in the command line, creating an MVC patterned web app has been really exciting!  As the case with the majority of the population, I've grown accustomed to interacting with a user interface of sorts.  So creating an application that actually renders in the browser is satisfying in a familiar sort of way.  While I have an enormous amount left to learn simply to cover the basics of web development, I have a new burst of energy feeling that I am finally moving into the "meat and potatoes" of the curriculum.  

That said, building in Sinatra for the first time was quite the challenge for me.  (Which is fun, because I love a good challenge!)  Ironically, in planning out my code, scratch paper and a pencil has become my best friend.  One of the most mind bending aspects of the process actually occurred before typing a single line - figuring out the relationships between my models.  Sometimes it is not so obvious whether to use a has_many, a has_many through, or a many to many relationship until drawing it out on paper.   In figuring this out, there is certainly an element of deciding what feels most intuitive and representative of the real world objects you are mimicking/organizing, but visualization definitely helps as well.
