title: A Gem of a Project
---

Today I have enthusiastically finished my first Ruby project, and am currently writing my first blog post (ever).  Ringing in the new year with new digital experiences.  :-)

As a student in [Flatiron School's Learn program] (https://learn.co), this project (a published Ruby gem), is to be my first progress assessment.  And I have to say, although my gem is still clunky, I'm feeling proud to have built something that works (mostly) as intended - from scratch!  

My first challenge was the process of getting started.  A blank slate can be both exciting and intimidating, and I felt both. Not to mention, I wanted to make something useful, as opposed to simply fulfilling the project requirements, so I was hung up for a few days on **what** to make. In many lectures, I have heard our instructor Avi say, "Build the code you wish you had."  So that is what I did. 

I've wrestled with severe food allergies my whole life (nuts and shellfish), and if my social plans for the evening potentially include going out to eat, this more than likely means I will spend hours beforehand scouring restaurant menus, in an attempt to find a place with a low occurrence of allergens.  Well, I really wish I had a tool to do that for me!  So I attempted to build one...
