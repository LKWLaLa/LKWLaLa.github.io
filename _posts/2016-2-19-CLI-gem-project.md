title: A Gem of a Project
---

Today I have enthusiastically finished my first Ruby project, and am currently writing my first blog post (ever).  Ringing in the new year with new digital experiences.  :-)

As a student in [Flatiron School's Learn program] (https://learn.co), this project (a published Ruby gem), is to be my first progress assessment.  And I have to say, even though my gem is still quite clunky and slow, I'm feeling proud to have built something that works (mostly) as intended, from scratch!
