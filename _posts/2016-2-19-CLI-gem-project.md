title: A Gem of a Project
---

Today I have enthusiastically finished my first Ruby project, and am currently writing my first blog post (ever).  Ringing in the new year with new digital experiences.  :-)

As a student in [Flatiron School's Learn program] (https://learn.co), this project (a published Ruby gem), is to be my first progress assessment.  And I have to say, although my gem is still clunky, I'm feeling proud to have built something that works (mostly) as intended - from scratch!  

My first challenge was the process of getting started.  A blank slate can be both exciting and intimidating, and I felt both. Not to mention, I wanted to make something useful, as opposed to simply fulfilling the project requirements, so I was hung up for a few days on **what** to make. In many lectures, our instructor Avi has said, "Build the code you wish you had."  So that is what I attempted to do. 

I've wrestled with severe food allergies my whole life (nuts and shellfish), and if my social plans for the evening potentially include going out to eat, this more than likely means I will spend hours beforehand scouring restaurant menus, in an attempt to find a place with a low occurrence of allergens.  Well, I really wish I had a tool to do that for me!  So I attempted to build one...  My Ruby gem, "eatable," currently scrapes and iterates though menus on menupages, searching for regex terms I have specified in two constants: NUTS and SHELL_FISH.  I've also specified a maximum threshold I will allow for each list (only two or less items on the menu may contain nuts, and three or less may contain shellfish).  The program will return the name/address/phone number of restaurants that meet the requirements.
