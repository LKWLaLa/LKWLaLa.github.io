title: Traversing the DOM (tra-la-la-la)
---

Month six of my development training, and I am wrapping up project 4 of 5.  This time around, the requirements directed us to build dynamic features onto our existing Rails app (project 3), using jQuery and an Active Model Serialization JSON API.  

Although it took a while to wrap my head around the lessons in this unit, working with Ajax and jQuery in my project was quite fun.  I often find my brain is able to solidify and fully understand concepts only after playing with them on my own terms, rather than in lesson exercises, and that happened to be the case in this situation, again.  

I'm sure there are best practices in navigating the DOM
