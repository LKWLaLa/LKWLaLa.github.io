title: Step by Step (finishing up my Rails project)
---

After a month and a half spent with Rails, I have finally begun refactoring and wrapping up my assessment project.  With it's high level "magic" helper methods, Rails is complex in every sense of the word.  In the process of learning I have found myself both excited by all of its possibility, and nostalgically missing the explicit ways of Sinatra.  My understanding of database relationships has been stretched to the breaking point.  Step by step (and error by error), I'm learning!

I thought it might be a good exercise to rewrite my Sinatra project using the Rails framework.  That way I could look back at my own work and compare the two approaches.  It was a good exercise, however, the many-to-many relationships that were quite easy to set up in my first project, grew into a dark labyrinth of broken associations when I added the dimension of nested attributes, forms, and resources.
